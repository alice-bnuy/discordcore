## Overview
This document tracks the bug fixes and improvements applied following the code review of the recent commits in the DiscordCore repository, particularly focusing on commit `e729f7a` (v0.105.0 - "feat: improve member role update detection and caching").

## 1. Critical Bug Fixes

### 1.1 Duplicate API Message Counter Increment
**File:** `pkg/discord/logging/monitoring.go`  
**Line:** ~509-510  
**Severity:** Medium  

**Problem:**
```go
atomic.AddUint64(&ms.apiMessagesSent, 1)
atomic.AddUint64(&ms.apiMessagesSent, 1)  // Duplicate!
```
The `apiMessagesSent` counter was being incremented twice for each role update notification sent via Audit Log, leading to inflated metrics.

**Fix:**
Removed the duplicate increment statement. Now correctly increments once per message sent.

**Impact:**
- Metrics accuracy improved
- `/admin metrics` command now reports correct message counts

### 1.2 Avatar "default" Sentinel Inconsistency
**Files:** 
- `pkg/discord/logging/notifications.go` (buildAvatarURL)
- Multiple locations storing avatars (monitoring.go, main.go, etc.)

**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
The codebase used inconsistent representations for default Discord avatars:
- Storage layer: Used `"default"` as a sentinel value when avatar hash was empty
- Display layer (`buildAvatarURL`): Only checked for empty string `""`

This caused two issues:
1. When `avatarHash == "default"` was passed to `buildAvatarURL`, it would construct an invalid URL: `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/{userID}/default.png` instead of generating the proper default avatar URL
2. Avatar change detection could trigger false positives when comparing `""` vs `"default"`

**Fix:**
Updated `buildAvatarURL` to handle both empty string and "default" sentinel:
```go
func (ns *NotificationSender) buildAvatarURL(userID, avatarHash string) string {
    // Handle both empty string and "default" sentinel for default avatars
    if avatarHash == "" || avatarHash == "default" {
        // Generate Discord default avatar based on user ID
        // ... existing logic ...
    }
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Avatar change notifications now display correct default avatar thumbnails
- No more invalid CDN URLs in embeds
- Consistent behavior across old and new data

## 2. Architecture Improvements

### 2.1 Unified Store Instance Management
**Files:**
- `pkg/discord/logging/member_events.go`
- `pkg/discord/logging/message_events.go`
- `pkg/discord/logging/monitoring.go`

**Severity:** Medium (Performance & Resource Management)

**Problem:**
Multiple components were creating their own SQLite Store instances pointing to the same database file:
- `main.go` created a shared store
- `MemberEventService` created its own store in `Start()`
- `MessageEventService` created its own store in constructor
- Only `PermissionChecker` was receiving the shared store

This caused:
- Unnecessary database connection overhead
- Potential lock contention
- Inconsistent caching behavior
- Resource wastage (multiple connection pools)

**Fix:**
Refactored service constructors to accept and use a shared Store instance:

**MemberEventService:**
```go
// Before
func NewMemberEventService(session, configManager, notifier) *MemberEventService {
    return &MemberEventService{...}
}

// After
func NewMemberEventService(session, configManager, notifier, store) *MemberEventService {
    return &MemberEventService{
        // ... other fields ...
        store: store,  // Injected instead of created
    }
}
```

**MessageEventService:**
```go
// Before
func NewMessageEventService(...) *MessageEventService {
    return &MessageEventService{
        store: storage.NewStore(util.GetMessageDBPath()),  // Created here
    }
}

// After
func NewMessageEventService(..., store *storage.Store) *MessageEventService {
    return &MessageEventService{
        store: store,  // Injected
    }
}
```

**MonitoringService updated:**
```go
memberEventService:  NewMemberEventService(session, configManager, n, store),
messageEventService: NewMessageEventService(session, configManager, n, store),
```

**Removed unnecessary initialization:**
- Removed `storage.NewStore()` calls from both services
- Removed `store.Init()` calls since the store is already initialized in main
- Removed unused `util` package imports

**Impact:**
- Single shared database connection pool
- Reduced resource usage
- Consistent cache state across services
- Simpler debugging and maintenance
- Better performance under load

## 3. Testing & Validation

### Build Verification
```bash
$ go build ./...
# Success - no compilation errors
```

### Diagnostics Check
```bash
# No errors or warnings found in the project
```

---

## 4. Recommendations for Future Work

### 4.1 Additional Testing
Consider adding unit tests for:
- Role diff logic (`store.DiffMemberRoles`)
- Avatar change detection with "default" sentinel values
- Metrics counter accuracy

### 4.2 Code Quality Improvements
- Consider using `strconv.ParseUint` in `buildAvatarURL` for more robust userID parsing
- Add context cancellation for `MetricsWatchCommand` goroutine for cleaner shutdown
- Review `LoadEnvWithLocalBinFallback` logic in main.go for clarity

### 4.3 Performance Monitoring
- Monitor the impact of shared Store instance on concurrency
- Consider adding connection pool metrics
- Track role cache hit rates in production
